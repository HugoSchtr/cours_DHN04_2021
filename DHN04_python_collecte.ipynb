            "minutes the Professor, in his dressing gown and slippers, appeared. When\n",
            "he saw Renfield on the ground, he looked keenly at him a moment, and\n",
            "then turned to me. I think he recognised my thought in my eyes, for he\n",

            "\"I heard your man call up Dr. Van Helsing and tell him of an accident.\n",
            "So I woke Quincey or rather called for him as he was not asleep. Things\n",
            "are moving too quickly and too strangely for sound sleep for any of us\n",
            "these times. I've been thinking that to-morrow night will not see things\n",

            "attitude and state of the patient, and noted the horrible pool on the\n",

            "\n",
            "\"My God! what has happened to him? Poor, poor devil!\" I told him\n",
            "briefly, and added that we expected he would recover consciousness after\n",

            "the blood clot; for it is evident that the h√¶morrhage is increasing.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "The minutes during which we waited passed with fearful slowness. I had a\n",
            "horrible sinking in my heart, and from Van Helsing's face I gathered\n",
            "that he felt some fear or apprehension as to what was to come. I dreaded\n",
            "the words that Renfield might speak. I was positively afraid to think;\n",
            "but the conviction of what was coming was on me, as I have read of men\n",
            "who have heard the death-watch. The poor man's breathing came in\n",
            "uncertain gasps. Each instant he seemed as though he would open his eyes\n",
            "and speak; but then would follow a prolonged stertorous breath, and he\n",
            "would relapse into a more fixed insensibility. Inured as I was to sick\n",
            "beds and death, this suspense grew, and grew upon me. I could almost\n",
            "hear the beating of my own heart; and the blood surging through my\n",
            "temples sounded like blows from a hammer. The silence finally became\n",
            "agonising. I looked at my companions, one after another, and saw from\n",
            "their flushed faces and damp brows that they were enduring equal\n",
            "torture. There was a nervous suspense over us all, as though overhead\n",

            "conscious, he looked at me piercingly with an agonised confusion which I\n",

            "\"I must not deceive myself; it was no dream, but all a grim reality.\"\n",
            "Then his eyes roved round the room; as they caught sight of the two\n",

            "bringing all his faculties to bear; when he opened them he said,\n",

            "spread over the grass, coming on like the shape of a flame of fire; and\n",
            "then He moved the mist to the right and left, and I could see that there\n",

This is the third of the surviving three volumes of Jane Austen''s juvenilia; ''Volume the First'' is in the Bodleian Library, Oxford (MS Don.e.7) and ''Volume the Second'' is in the British Library (Add. 59874). All contain copies, with some later additions and revisions, of original manuscripts which do not survive. On the inner front cover (f. ii), Jane Austen''s father, the Rev. George Austen, has noted in pencil: ''Effusions of Fancy by a very Young Lady consisting of Tales in a Style entirely new''. The contents page (f. 1) is signed ''Jane Austen May 6th 1792''; the dedication of ''Catharine'' (originally entitled ''Kitty'') to Cassandra Austen (f. 16v) is dated ''Steventon August 1792''; and at the end of ''Evelyn'', the last few pages of which (ff. 12-15) are in an unidentified hand, is the date ''August 19th 1809''. This hand appears again towards the end of ''Catharine'' (ff. 63v-64); the last two pages of the story, which is unfinished, are in the hand of Jane Austen''s nephew, James Edward Austen Leigh (ff. 64v-65). Four pages loosely inserted at the end of the volume (ff. 66-69), containing a contribution to ''Evelyn'', are in the hand of Jane Austen''s eldest niece, Jane Anna Elizabeth Lefroy, and are signed with her initials. See R. W. Chapman, Volume the Third by Jane Austen (Oxford, 1951); notes by him, dated 28 and 30 July 1950, are inserted at the end of the volume (ff. iii, iv). See also B. C. Southam, ''Interpolations to Jane Austen''s Volume the Third'', in Notes and Queries, vol. 207 (May 1962), pp. 185-187. Dedication to James Edward Austen Leigh, in the hand of Cassandra Austen, at f. 1. Purchased, with the aid of a grant from the National Heritage Memorial Fund, at Sotheby''s, 27 Sept. 1988, lot 108.
